CinderJpgStream
===============

Capturing Motion jpg streams in Cinder based on the excellent work of this openframeworks addon https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIpVideoGrabber
Only implemented the bare minimum.
Will implement the other features when needed :)

Known issues:
- restarting of a stream doesn't work
