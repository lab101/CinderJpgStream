CinderJpgStream
===============

Capturing Motion jpg streams in Cinder based on the excellent work of this openframeworks addon https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIpVideoGrabber
Mostly removed all the poco stuff and replaced it with boost

Known issues:
- restarting of a stream doesn't work
- boost compile error on cinder 0.85
